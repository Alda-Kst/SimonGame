# SimonGame
## This is a front-end web game. This game is extremely basic. You just press any key to trigger the game mechanism that beeps one of the four colored boxes on the screen. The beeped box goes into an array which stores the sequence of colored buttons to be pressed.The user then has to copy that particular sequence and once the full sequence has been copied another color button gets added to that sequence making the sequence longer as each level progresses.

## I added sounds to the game upon button pressing and gameover sound when the player loses the game.All the files are available in the sounds folder.

### Demo
